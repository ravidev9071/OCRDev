								<p>XIAFLEX is approved for the treatment of adult men with Peyronie's disease with a
									palpable plaque and curvature deformity of at least 30 degrees at the start of
									therapy. XIAFLEX should be administered by a healthcare provider experienced in the
									treatment of male urological diseases, who has completed required training for use
									of XIAFLEX in the treatment of Peyronie's disease. </p>
								<div class="dividerSolid"></div>
								<div class="slds-text-heading_large">What is the XIAFLEX REMS?</div>
								<p>A REMS (<u>Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy</u>) is a strategy to
									manage
									known or potential serious risks associated with a drug and is required by
									the
									Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that the benefits of the drug
									outweigh its risks. Endo USA, Inc. has worked with the FDA to develop
									the
									XIAFLEX REMS.</p>
								<br>
								<p>The XIAFLEX REMS requires a review of educational materials, training, and
									certification.</p>
								<br>
								<p>XIAFLEX is available for the treatment of Peyronie's disease only through the
									XIAFLEX REMS. The XIAFLEX REMS requirements include:</p>

								<ul class="listItemDisc">
									<li><b>Training</b> for healthcare providers on the risks of corporal
										rupture
										and other serious injuries to the penis that can occur with XIAFLEX
										treatment, such as severe penile hematoma or ecchymoses, skin and soft
										tissue necrosis, swelling, and pain.</li>
									<li><b>Certification</b> in the XIAFLEX REMS by completing training and
										enrollment in the program.</li>
									<li><b>Patient counseling</b> about the risks of corporal rupture and other
										serious injuries to the penis that can occur with XIAFLEX treatment,
										such as
										severe penile hematoma or ecchymoses, skin and soft tissue necrosis,
										swelling, and pain as well as the importance of patient adherence to
										post-injection instructions. Healthcare Providers must give patients the
										Patient Counseling Tool, <a href={urlFile} target="_blank"><b>What You Need to
												Know About XIAFLEX Treatment for Peyronie's Disease: A Patient
												Guide</b></a>, after each XIAFLEX injection.</li>
									<li><b>Restricted Distribution</b> through specially certified healthcare
										settings (e.g., pharmacies, practitioners, hospitals or outpatient
										settings).</li>
								</ul>
